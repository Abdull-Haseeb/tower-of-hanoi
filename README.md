# Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and a popular example in data structures and algorithms. It is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack (either an empty rod or a rod with a larger disk on top).
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Problem Statement

The problem can be described as follows:

Given 'n' disks on the source rod, along with two other rods (an auxiliary rod and a destination rod), we need to find the minimum number of moves required to transfer all the disks from the source rod to the destination rod using the auxiliary rod.

## Algorithm

The algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem can be described recursively:

1. If the number of disks is 1, simply move it from the source rod to the destination rod.
2. If the number of disks is greater than 1, follow these steps:
   - Move the top 'n-1' disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod, using the destination rod.
   - Move the bottom disk from the source rod to the destination rod.
   - Move the 'n-1' disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod, using the source rod.

## Implementation

Below is a Python implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem:

```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source_rod, auxiliary_rod, destination_rod):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source_rod} to {destination_rod}")
        return
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source_rod, destination_rod, auxiliary_rod)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source_rod} to {destination_rod}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary_rod, source_rod, destination_rod)

# Example usage:
n = 3
tower_of_hanoi(n, 'A', 'B', 'C')


```

## Interview Questions

1. **Explain the Tower of Hanoi problem to me.**

   The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a set of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules. The problem is often used to illustrate recursion and problem-solving concepts in computer science.

2. **Can you describe the rules that need to be followed while solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle?**

   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
   - Each move involves taking the top disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack, which can be either an empty rod or a rod with a larger disk on top.
   - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

3. **Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem in your preferred programming language.**

   The Python implementation provided earlier in this document demonstrates a recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.

4. **What is the time complexity of your implementation? Can we improve it further?**

   The time complexity of the recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem is O(2^n), where 'n' is the number of disks. The exponential time complexity arises because each recursive call leads to two additional recursive calls. Although the exponential time complexity cannot be avoided for the recursive solution, the iterative approach can be used to optimize the problem.

5. **Can you explain how recursion is used to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem? Are there any other approaches?**

   Recursion is utilized in the Tower of Hanoi problem by breaking it down into subproblems. When moving 'n' disks, the problem is divided into moving 'n-1' disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod, moving the bottom disk from the source rod to the destination rod, and then moving the 'n-1' disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod. This process continues recursively until the base case is reached (i.e., only one disk needs to be moved).

   Besides recursion, an iterative approach using stacks or queues can also be employed to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.

6. **Is the number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem the same for any number of disks? Why or why not?**

   No, the number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem is not the same for any number of disks. The minimum number of moves needed to solve the problem with 'n' disks is 2^n - 1. As the number of disks increases, the number of moves grows exponentially.

7. **Can you solve the Tower of Hanoi problem iteratively instead of using recursion? If yes, provide an implementation.**

   Yes, the Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved iteratively using stacks or queues to simulate the recursive calls. Implementing an iterative solution is often more efficient than the recursive solution, especially for a large number of disks.

8. **How would you modify the Tower of Hanoi problem if there were four rods instead of three? Would the solution approach be the same?**

   If there were four rods, the problem would be known as the Tower of Brahma. The rules would remain the same, but the approach would change to consider four rods instead of three. The algorithm would be adapted to move the disks among the four rods while maintaining the rules of the game.

Remember that the Tower of Hanoi problem is often used to assess a candidate's understanding of recursion and problem-solving skills, so it's essential to be familiar with the concept and have a clear explanation of your solution.
